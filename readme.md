# Simple weather application
A simple weather application server built as the second project during the Udemy class [The Complete Node.js Developer Course (3rd Edition)](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-nodejs-developer-course-2/) by Andrew Mead.

## Installation
Just run `npm install` to install dependancies

You need both a Mapbox and Darksky API token to use the application.
Declare these tokens in the `config/tokens.env`, using the variables `MAPBOX_API` and `DARKSKY_API`.

## Quick start
Run the terminal command `npm run weather-server` in the application directory, then visit the page in a web browser.
